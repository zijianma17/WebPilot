      Your account name is ‘Byte Blaze’. Any personal pronouns like ‘my’ should refer to your account name.
    - |
      If the "Main Task" involves finding items like issues or merge requests, always include a separate subtask to set the status to ‘all’ before searching for specific keywords or sorting. This ensures no relevant items are missed, providing comprehensive coverage and accurate results, even if the main task does not specify the status of the items.
    - |
      The top bar and the sidebar might lead to different domains. Elements in the top bar lead to the user account-related pages, while elements in the sidebar lead to the pages related to the current project/repository. When planning, if the 'Observation Description' indicates a general projects list page rather than a specific project page, use the top bar for navigation. If it indicates a specific project page, use the sidebar for navigation. Each navigation subtask, except for navigating to the homepage of a project repository, must specify whether to use the top bar or the sidebar for navigation.
    - |
      If the "Main Task" has the word 'branch', you MUST include a separate subtask titled 'Set the branch' in the generated plan. The branch main is not the default branch. In GitLab, the ‘Master’ branch is referred to as the ‘Main’ branch. This setting branch subtask must be the conducted directly after entering the project repository and before any other subtasks.
    - |
      The commits cannot be filtered by author or date. Searching is also not allowed. You MUST NOT generate a subtask to filter the commits. After navigating to the commits page, scroll through the commits to find the required information.
    - |
      When creating a new group and inviting members, the group must be successfully created. You cannot invite members directly on the group creation page. Inviting each member must be a single subtask.
    - |
      After the creation of a project/group, you need to navigate back to its homepage before setting up any other subtasks. When forking other projects, you have to select a namespace before forking.
  controller:
    - |
      Your account name is ‘Byte Blaze’.

      When the task involves specific branches, it needs to be checked explicitly and must be exact. However the "Master" branch is the "Main" branch in Gitlab. "Setting a branch" MUST be a single subtask after entering the project repo and before any other subtasks. However, if the task does not specify the branch, you should keep the current branch and do not change it.
    - |
      When sorting the items, you must ensure you choose the correct one specified in the task.
    - |
      Date information is in the format of "MM/DD/YYYY". For example, "05/02/2022" means May 2, 2022. 
    - |
      When verifying the project name, there might be a user name before the project name. For example, "John Doe / robotics" and "robotics" refers to the same project.
    - |
      When the target page should be the project or user's page, be careful to check it. Distinguish them between the search result page.

      Elements with same name (issues, merge requests) might be one from the top bar(appear earlier in the actree) and one from the sidebar(appear later in the actree). They lead to different pages. When the task involves items related to account, use the top bar. When it involves current project/repository, use the sidebar.
    - |
      When sorting the items, you must first bring up the dropdown options and choose the appropriate sorting option.

      Clicking on date/time elements will not lead to the corresponding page. Date/time elements are only informative and for reference.

      If the desired project is not visible in the listed items, make full use of the search functionality on the page to accurately locate the target project. Do NOT rely on guessing to choose a possible project.

      Use ‘Search GitLab’ for broad searches across the entire platform, like finding projects, users, or groups. However, it is NOT suitable for searching within a specific project.

      Use the section-specific textboxes in the main body, such as in Issues, to search within the current project. Do NOT use the ‘Search GitLab’ textbox for this type of search.

      The commits cannot be filtered by author or date. Searching is also NOT allowed. When you are in the commits page, you can only scroll through the commits to find the required information.

      If the task requires to get the estimated time or distance between two locations, the first subtask MUST be navigating to the route planning page, and search for the two locations.      
    - |
      When searching for a location with extra information, consider removing prepositions. For example, turn "Apple Store in New York" into "Apple Store New York". These kinds of tasks only need one subtask. Also add the city name if the location is a common name. For example, "Hotel Marriott" should be "Hotel Marriott New York", according to the task.
    - |
      By default, the transportation mode is set to "driving". You can ignore the transportation mode setting if the task does not specify it.
    - |
      When the location mentioned by the task is not the name but a description, use your own knowledge to translate the description into a location name in the subtask.

      If you know the answer already, for example, the state bordering California, you could plan a subtask that directly provides the answer.

      If you want to get the zip code, address of a location, you can directly get the information from the search result page without clicking on the result. But the coordinates of the location can only be obtained by clicking on the result and then clicking "Where is this?".

      When searching places around a location, directly search the keyword '{places} near {location}' in the search box.

      Some places is ambiguous, turn it into a specific location. For example, "CMU main campus" should be "Carnegie Mellon University".
